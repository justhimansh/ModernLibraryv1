# Modern Online Library with HTML/CSS/JS

This project was simply to see what I was able to do after taking 
few courses in HTML and CSS with a little bit of prior JS knowledge.
I decided to go with a modern library as I would recommended these books
to anyone who is getting into software engineering as well as developing.

## Lessons Learned

Building this project helped me understand the importance of writing clean and reusable
code. Being able to use the same class <div> throughout the project really enabled me 
to build this project as efficiently as possible. This allowed me to add books with
very minimal lines of code and instead reuse what I have previously written.
